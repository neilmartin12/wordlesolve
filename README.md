# wordlesolve
> wordlesolve solves Wordle!

*wordlesolve* will solve almost any Wordle puzzle within six guesses. Just follow the suggestions and type in the results.

## Installation

```sh
pip install wordlesolve
```

## Usage

### Solve mode

```sh
python3 -m wordlesolve
```
or
```sh
>>> from wordlesolve import Solver
>>> solver = Solver()
>>> solver.solve()
```

*wordlesolve* gives you up to five suggestions for each guess.
Type in the guess you use and the outcome Wordle gives for each letter: 0 for grey, 1 for yellow, 2 for green.

For example if you guess RATES and get

enter:
* Your guess: RATES
* Outcome: 02100

*wordlesolve* will use that information to suggest some more guesses, getting you closer to the solution each time!

### Play mode

*wordlesolve* also includes a play mode - a console-based Wordle clone. Not nearly as good as [the real thing](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) but fun to practise!

```sh
python3 -m wordlesolve -p
```
or
```sh
>>> from wordlesolve import Solver
>>> solver = Solver()
>>> solver.play()
```

### Test mode

Also included is a test mode - this was originally intended to test the algorithm during development. Test mode runs the solve algorithm against any number of solutions, either provided or randomly selected from the built-in database, and provides information on how quickly each was solved.

```sh
python3 -m wordlesolve -t -c 10 -v
```
or
```sh
>>> from wordlesolve import Solver
>>> solver = Solver()
>>> solver.test(count=10, verbosity=1)
```

### Options
Each *wordlesolve* mode takes a number of configuration options, either as command line switches or keyword argments.
